Hey there. This is a basic software engineering blog to share the challenges that I faced along the way. It mostly serves me as one of the databases to refer to as I encounter the same issue again, StackOverflow being the other one.

I studied computer science at the [EPF - Graduate School of Engineering](http://www.epf.fr/en), class of 2017. I worked for [Volkswagen](http://www.vwerl.com/) for over a year in California and am now working for a contracting company in Paris since Nov. 2018.
